# Doodle classification in AI for interactive media 

## Project Description 

Feasibility: Train the AI with an existing doodle database using neural network. We will follow TensorFlows tutorial for “Recurrent Neural Networks for Drawing Classification” to create our training model. We will use the Quick, Draw! dataset which has over 50 million drawings. We will not use the whole dataset but choose around 100 categories out of 345. To understand how everything works and the techniques behind it we will create our own model after following the tutorials. This way we will learn what parameters we can twist and change, and therefore understand TensorFlow and neural networks better.

Description: The user will get a word and be asked to draw that. The AI will then have the mission to guess what the user is drawing. If the AI guesses correct then a new word will appear for the user to draw.
